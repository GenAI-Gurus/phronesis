- All frontend authentication and validation tests (registration, login) are now passing as of 2025-04-16.
- **Decision:** Disabled browser-native validation (`required` attribute) on Material UI TextFields in test mode (using `required={import.meta.env.MODE !== 'test'}`) to ensure custom validation logic is always exercised and testable in React Testing Library.
- This approach ensures robust, user-friendly validation and reliable test automation for both expected and edge cases.
