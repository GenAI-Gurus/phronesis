1. Overview & Vision

Phronesis is a B2C platform that supports users in reflecting on past decisions, capturing those insights, and providing decision support tailored to their values, personality, and personal circumstances. The objective is to cultivate a habit of mindful decision-making that becomes increasingly powerful over time. The app will leverage the user-generated decision data as a feedback flywheel—enabling deeper personalization and distinct competitive advantages through its continuously refined insights.

2. Core Features

2.1. User Registration & Profiles
Sign-Up/Login:
Simple registration using email or social logins.
User profiles capture basic information such as name, demographics, and a preliminary “Values Blueprint” (a self-assessment on core values).
Dashboard:
A clean dashboard that shows recent activities, decision history, and progress metrics (streaks, badges, trends).
2.2. Decision Journal Module
Entry Interface:
A simplified form to log a decision with fields for title, context, anticipated outcomes, and the values the decision touches upon.
Minimal friction inputs with optional voice-to-text capabilities.
Reflection Prompts:
AI-generated follow-up questions (e.g., “Was this aligned with your goal of personal growth?”) to encourage deeper reflection.
Tagging & Categorization:
Automatic tagging of decisions by domain (e.g., career, health, relationships) and sentiment analysis.
2.3. Value Calibration Engine
Periodic Check-ins:
Regular, quiz-like surveys for users to update or reaffirm their core values.
A “tension detection” feature that flags discrepancies when past decisions diverge from current values.
Personal Evolution:
Visualization tools (e.g., progress timelines, “value heatmaps”) that show shifts in values over time.
2.4. Decision Support AI
Context-Aware Assistance:
Integration with OpenAI services to analyze past decision logs and offer personalized insights or suggestions for future decisions.
A chat-based interface where users can ask for advice on complex decisions. The system replies with actionable trade-offs or simulations (e.g., “Future-Self Simulator” that projects long-term impact).
2.5. Gamification & Engagement Features
Daily Challenges & Streaks:
Daily “decision sprints” or reflection challenges (similar to Duolingo’s daily tasks) to foster routine engagement.
Achievement badges for consistency, insightful reflections, or breakthroughs in alignment.
Notifications & Reminders:
Push notifications and email reminders to encourage regular use (e.g., “How did your decision from yesterday hold up?”).
Progress Tracking:
Visual metrics (e.g., weekly decision logs, improvement scores) that make the abstract process of decision improvement tangible and rewarding.
3. Data-Driven Flywheel

Data Collection:
All user interactions (decision logs, reflection entries, survey responses, AI interactions) are stored in a structured format.
Analytics & Personalization:
Use aggregated data to uncover patterns. For instance, recommend personalized reflection prompts based on past behavior.
A continuous feedback loop improves the quality of AI prompts and decision support insights.
Competitive Differentiation:
The richer the individual’s data set, the more tailored and valuable the insights—creating a scalable flywheel where increased engagement yields exponential personalization benefits.
Data Export & Benchmarking:
Users may (optionally) receive periodic summaries comparing their progression with anonymized aggregate data from similar profiles, further engaging them.
4. Technical Architecture

4.1. Frontend
Framework:
Build a responsive, mobile-first web application using ReactJS (or a similar JavaScript framework).
User Interface:
Clean, intuitive layout with dashboards, forms for decision logging, and progress visualizations.
Progressive Web App (PWA):
Ensure offline support and mobile-like experiences without requiring a native app download.
4.2. Backend & API
Language & Framework:
Use Python with a modern web framework such as FastAPI or Django.
RESTful API endpoints will handle user authentication, decision logging, value calibration, and AI interactions.
Database:
Use Azure SQL Database or Azure Cosmos DB to store structured user data.
Integration with OpenAI:
Leverage the OpenAI API for generating reflective prompts and decision support dialogue. Use secure API key management and rate-limiting for cost control.
4.3. Cloud Infrastructure & Scalability
Azure Cloud:
Deploy the backend using Azure App Service or Azure Functions to achieve serverless scalability, ensuring that costs grow in proportion to usage.
Use Azure Blob Storage for storing any user-generated content (text logs, audio recordings).
Scaling:
Employ auto-scaling policies and containerization (Docker) to minimize costs during low usage periods.
Monitoring & Logging:
Implement Azure Application Insights to monitor performance, usage patterns, and errors.
5. Security & Compliance

Data Protection:
Ensure end-to-end encryption for user data in transit and at rest.
Follow best practices for securing API keys and sensitive information.
Regulatory Compliance:
Build with GDPR (and other relevant standards) in mind, offering users tools to export and delete their data.
Access Control:
Use role-based access controls to limit who can view and modify data in both the application and administrative dashboards.
6. Success Metrics

User Engagement:
Daily active users, weekly decision logs, and reflection completion rates.
Retention:
User retention and engagement streak metrics.
System Performance:
API response times, error rates, and scalability metrics as user base grows.
Data Quality:
Volume and richness of logged decisions and reflections that inform improved personalization.
7. Cost Management Strategy

Serverless Architecture:
Utilize Azure Functions/App Services to only pay for actual compute usage, keeping costs aligned with active user sessions.
Modular Infrastructure:
Design services so that data analytics and AI components scale separately based on demand.
Monitoring & Alerts:
Set up Azure monitoring to track usage spikes and adjust resources automatically to prevent over-provisioning.
