## Decision Chat Endpoints (MVP)\n\n## Future-Self Simulator API

## Gamification API

## OpenAI Integration (Decision Support & Future-Self Simulator)

- **Endpoints:**
  - `/api/v1/decision-support/chat` (POST)
  - `/api/v1/future-self/simulate` (POST)
- **AI Model:** OpenAI GPT-4.1-nano (configurable via `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- **How it works:**
  - If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set, requests are sent to OpenAI for AI-powered responses.
  - If the API key is missing or OpenAI is unavailable, endpoints return a robust mock response with fallback suggestions.
  - No request/response schema changes—frontend remains compatible.
- **Environment Variable:**
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required for live AI)
- **Testing:**
  - Pytest unit tests mock OpenAI for both success and failure.
  - Tests verify both AI and fallback logic.
- **Security:**
  - API key is never hardcoded; always loaded from environment/config.
  - All endpoints require authentication.


- **GET /api/v1/gamification/streaks**
  - Returns current user streaks (e.g., check-in streaks)
  - **Response:**
    ```json
    [
      { "id": "...", "streak_count": 7, "last_checkin": "2025-04-19T12:00:00Z" }
    ]
    ```

- **GET /api/v1/gamification/badges**
  - Returns badges earned by the user
  - **Response:**
    ```json
    [
      { "id": "...", "name": "7-Day Streak", "description": "Check in 7 days in a row", "awarded_at": "2025-04-19T12:00:00Z" }
    ]
    ```

- **GET /api/v1/gamification/challenges**
  - Returns available and completed challenges for the user
  - **Response:**
    ```json
    [
      { "id": "...", "name": "First Reflection", "description": "Complete your first reflection", "is_active": true, "completed_at": null }
    ]
    ```

- **POST /api/v1/gamification/challenges/{challenge_id}/complete**
  - Mark a challenge as completed for the user
  - **Response:**
    ```json
    { "id": "...", "name": "First Reflection", "description": "Complete your first reflection", "is_active": true, "completed_at": "2025-04-19T12:00:00Z" }
    ```

**Summary:**
- Streaks are tracked for user check-ins or journal entries.
- Badges are awarded for milestones (e.g., 7-day streak, first reflection).
- Challenges can be completed and tracked per user.
- All endpoints require authentication.
- See `app/models/gamification.py` and `app/schemas/gamification.py` for data structures.
\n\n- **POST /api/v1/future-self/simulate**\n- **Auth:** Required (JWT Bearer)\n- **Purpose:** AI-powered simulation of user's likely \"future self\" based on a decision context, values, and optional time horizon.\n\n### Request Schema\n```json\n{\n  \"decision_context\": \"Should I move to a new city for a job opportunity?\",\n  \"values\": [\"growth\", \"security\"],\n  \"time_horizon\": \"2 years\"\n}\n```\n\n### Response Schema\n```json\n{\n  \"future_projection\": \"In two years, after moving to the new city, you have grown professionally and expanded your network. The transition was challenging at first, but you adapted and found new sources of security and fulfillment.\",\n  \"suggestions\": [\n    \"Research neighborhoods and cost of living.\",\n    \"Connect with local professional groups before moving.\",\n    \"Reflect on what you need to feel secure during transitions.\"\n  ],\n  \"ai_generated\": true\n}\n```\n\n- **Summary:** Simulate your “future self” based on a decision context and values.\n- **Description:** Uses AI to project a narrative of your likely future self given a specific decision, values, and optional time horizon.\n- **Tags:** [\"future-self\", \"simulation\", \"decision support\"]\n

- **Create Session:** `POST /api/v1/decisions/sessions` — `{ "title": string }` → `{ "id": UUID, ... }`
- **List Sessions:** `GET /api/v1/decisions/sessions`
- **Create Message:** `POST /api/v1/decisions/sessions/{session_id}/messages` — `{ "content": string, "sender": "user"|"ai" }` → `{ "id": UUID, ... }`
- **List Messages:** `GET /api/v1/decisions/sessions/{session_id}/messages`
- **Update Session:** `PATCH /api/v1/decisions/sessions/{session_id}`
- All endpoints require JWT authentication and return proper status codes (401, 404, 422).
- Full Pytest coverage: see `/backend/tests/app/api/v1/endpoints/test_decisions.py`.

## Database Migrations (Alembic)

To keep your database schema in sync with your SQLAlchemy models, use Alembic migrations as follows:

### 1. Local Development (SQLite)
- Set `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./dev.db` in your `.env` file.
- Generate a new migration after changing models:
  ```sh
  poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Describe your change"
  ```

### 2. Production (Azure SQL)
- Set `DATABASE_URL` to your Azure SQL connection string (from Key Vault or Azure Portal).
- Apply all migrations to your cloud database:
  ```sh
  poetry run alembic upgrade head
  ```

### Notes
- This ensures your schema is up to date both locally and in production.
- See `backend/.env.example` and `backend/alembic/` for configuration and migration scripts.
- Only generate migrations from the main branch and after verifying model changes.

## Deploying to Azure App Service (Docker)

1. **Build and Push Docker Image**
   - Azure App Service can build directly from your repo, or you can build/push to Azure Container Registry (ACR):
     ```sh
     docker build -t phronesis-backend .
     docker tag phronesis-backend <youracr>.azurecr.io/phronesis-backend:latest
     docker push <youracr>.azurecr.io/phronesis-backend:latest
     ```
2. **Configure App Service**
   - Set environment variables (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.) in the Azure Portal (Configuration > Application settings).
   - Do NOT commit secrets; use Azure Key Vault or App Service settings.
3. **Run Database Migrations**
   - Use the Azure Cloud Shell or a CI/CD step:
     ```sh
     poetry run alembic upgrade head
     ```
4. **Dockerfile and .dockerignore**
   - See `backend/Dockerfile` for the production build setup.
   - See `backend/.dockerignore` to keep Docker images clean and builds fast.

For more details, see Azure App Service [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-custom-container?tabs=python&pivots=container-linux).
