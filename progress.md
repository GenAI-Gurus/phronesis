- *specification.md (see Architecture Design and User Journey Diagrams sections)*

[x] 4. Set Up Version Control

*Git repository initialized and connected to remote:*
- *https://github.com/GenAI-Gurus/phronesis*
- *.gitignore, README.md, and MIT LICENSE added and pushed to main branch.*
- *Project is ready for open-source collaboration and advanced user contributions.*

[x] 5. Initialize Python Project

*Modular FastAPI backend scaffolded in the `backend/` directory, designed for maintainability and AI-friendly expansion. See:*
- *backend/README.md (project overview)*
- *backend/STRUCTURE.md (folder and module structure)*
- *backend/requirements.txt (core dependencies)*

[x] 6. Implement Decision Chat Session & Message Endpoints

*CRUD API endpoints for DecisionChatSession and DecisionChatMessage, with Pydantic validation, database integration, and Pytest unit tests (expected, edge, failure cases) are implemented and tested. All tests pass as of 2025-04-15.*
- *Endpoints in backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/decisions.py*
- *Models in backend/app/models/decision.py, reflection.py*
- *Tests in tests/app/api/v1/endpoints/test_decisions.py*

[x] 7. Establish Dependency Management

*Backend folder structure is modular, AI-friendly, and documented in backend/STRUCTURE.md. Ready for scalable development.*

[x] 9. Configure Local Development Environment

*.env.example added for safe, maintainable environment variable management. Local dev server can be started with `poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload`. See backend/README.md for instructions.*

[x] 10. Set Up Azure Cloud Resources
[x] 10. Provision Azure App Service

*Azure App Service (Linux, Python 3.11) was provisioned using Bicep templates as described in infra/bicep/README.md. See Azure Portal for resource details.*

### Discovered During Work
- Fixed frontend test runner config: Use `npx vitest run` for non-interactive tests; updated tests to use robust async queries for Material UI dialogs.
- Fixed backend test teardown to avoid SQLite readonly errors by checking if test.db exists before removal.

- Disabled the `required` attribute on Material UI TextFields in test mode (via `required={import.meta.env.MODE !== 'test'}`) to ensure custom validation logic is exercised and testable in React Testing Library.
