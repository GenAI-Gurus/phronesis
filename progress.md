# Project Progress Tracker

_This file tracks the status of all project tasks, milestones, and discovered work. For requirements and architecture, see specification.md._

## In Progress
- [ ] Implement Chat for a New decision, instead of a form based approach
    - The canonical specification and prompt engineering for the Decision Chat feature are documented in [docs/decision_chat_design.md](docs/decision_chat_design.md). All implementation, testing, and future enhancements should align with this document.

## Upcoming / TODO
- [ ] Implement Optional Social Login
- [ ] Integrate Speech-to-Text (Optional)
- [ ] Set Up Push Notifications
- [ ] Implement Email Notification System
- [ ] Build Analytics & Reporting Module
- [ ] Construct an Admin Dashboard
- [ ] Integrate Application Insights
- [ ] Perform Load and Stress Testing
- [ ] Continue to improve safety and robustness of automated DB migrations (see .github/workflows/azure-backend.yml and specification.md)
    - Add pre-migration backup, manual approval for production, and/or rollback strategy.
    - Review Azure App Service + Alembic best practices for zero-downtime and safe schema changes.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Finalize Product Requirements
    *Product requirements, vision, and scope finalized based on user feedback. The single source of truth for requirements is:*
    - *specification.md (canonical product & technical specification)*
    - *decisions_log.md (rationale and historical context only)*
    - *PRS_original.md (historical reference, superseded)*
- [x] Define Key Data Entities
    *Key data entities for the MVP are now finalized and documented in:*
    - *decisions_log.md (agreement and rationale)*
    - *specification.md (current product specification)*
- [x] Architecture Design Document
    *System architecture, data flow, and all diagrams are finalized and fully documented in:*
    - *specification.md (see Architecture Design and User Journey Diagrams sections)*
- [x] Set Up Version Control
    *Git repository initialized and connected to remote:*
    - *https://github.com/GenAI-Gurus/phronesis*
    - *.gitignore, README.md, and MIT LICENSE added and pushed to main branch.*
    - *Project is ready for open-source collaboration and advanced user contributions.*
- [x] Initialize Python Project
    *Modular FastAPI backend scaffolded in the `backend/` directory, designed for maintainability and AI-friendly expansion. See:*
    - *backend/README.md (project overview)*
    - *backend/STRUCTURE.md (folder and module structure)*
    - *backend/requirements.txt (core dependencies)*
- [x] Implement Decision Chat Session & Message Endpoints
    *CRUD API endpoints for DecisionChatSession and DecisionChatMessage, with Pydantic validation, database integration, and Pytest unit tests (expected, edge, failure cases) are implemented and tested. All tests pass as of 2025-04-15.*
    - *Endpoints in backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/decisions.py*
    - *Models in backend/app/models/decision.py, reflection.py*
    - *Tests in tests/app/api/v1/endpoints/test_decisions.py*
- [x] Establish Dependency Management (Poetry)
    *Poetry installed and configured for the backend. Dependencies managed in pyproject.toml/poetry.lock. requirements.txt is now obsolete and will be removed.*
- [x] Design Backend Folder Structure
    *Backend folder structure is modular, AI-friendly, and documented in backend/STRUCTURE.md. Ready for scalable development.*
- [x] Configure Local Development Environment
    *.env.example added for safe, maintainable environment variable management. Local dev server can be started with `poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload`. See backend/README.md for instructions.*
- [x] Set Up Azure Cloud Resources & Provision App Service
    *Azure App Service (Linux, Python 3.11) was provisioned using Bicep templates as described in infra/bicep/README.md. See Azure Portal for resource details.*
- [x] Provision a Database on Azure
    *Azure SQL Database was provisioned using Bicep templates. Admin login and password were set securely, and the SQL firewall rule was intentionally skipped due to dynamic developer IP (see decisions_log.md). Azure-internal access is enabled by default.*
- [x] Set Up Database Security (Key Vault)
    *Database connection is secured using Azure Key Vault. The backend loads the DATABASE_URL from environment variables, which should point to Key Vault in production and to SQLite for local development. See .env.example for details.*
- [x] Design Database Schema & Migrations
    *All core and gamification entities are modeled in SQLAlchemy. Alembic is set up for migrations. See backend/README.md for database migration instructions using Alembic. This ensures your schema is up to date both locally and in production.*
- [x] Implement User Registration API
    */api/v1/register endpoint implemented. Validates email and password, checks for duplicates, hashes password, and returns new user info.*
- [x] Implement Authentication
    */api/v1/login endpoint implemented. Verifies credentials and returns JWT access token on success.*
- [x] Develop User Profile API
    */api/v1/me endpoints implemented. Supports authenticated profile retrieval and update for current user.*
