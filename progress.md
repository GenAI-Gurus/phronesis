[x] 1. Finalize Product Requirements

*Product requirements, vision, and scope finalized based on user feedback. All details and agreements are documented in:*
- *decisions_log.md (finalized decisions and clarifications)*
- *specification.md (current product specification)*
- *PRS_original.md (original PRS for reference)*

[x] 2. Define Key Data Entities

*Key data entities for the MVP are now finalized and documented in:*
- *decisions_log.md (agreement and rationale)*
- *specification.md (current product specification)*

[x] 3. Architecture Design Document

*System architecture, data flow, and all diagrams are finalized and fully documented in:*
- *specification.md (see Architecture Design and User Journey Diagrams sections)*

[x] 4. Set Up Version Control

*Git repository initialized and connected to remote:*
- *https://github.com/GenAI-Gurus/phronesis*
- *.gitignore, README.md, and MIT LICENSE added and pushed to main branch.*
- *Project is ready for open-source collaboration and advanced user contributions.*

[x] 5. Initialize Python Project

*Modular FastAPI backend scaffolded in the `backend/` directory, designed for maintainability and AI-friendly expansion. See:*
- *backend/README.md (project overview)*
- *backend/STRUCTURE.md (folder and module structure)*
- *backend/requirements.txt (core dependencies)*

[x] 6. Implement Decision Chat Session & Message Endpoints

*CRUD API endpoints for DecisionChatSession and DecisionChatMessage, with Pydantic validation, database integration, and Pytest unit tests (expected, edge, failure cases) are implemented and tested. All tests pass as of 2025-04-15.*
- *Endpoints in backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/decisions.py*
- *Models in backend/app/models/decision.py, reflection.py*
- *Tests in tests/app/api/v1/endpoints/test_decisions.py*

[x] 7. Establish Dependency Management

*Poetry installed and configured for the backend. Dependencies managed in pyproject.toml/poetry.lock. requirements.txt is now obsolete and will be removed.*

[x] 8. Design Backend Folder Structure

*Backend folder structure is modular, AI-friendly, and documented in backend/STRUCTURE.md. Ready for scalable development.*

[x] 9. Configure Local Development Environment

*.env.example added for safe, maintainable environment variable management. Local dev server can be started with `poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload`. See backend/README.md for instructions.*

[x] 10. Set Up Azure Cloud Resources
[x] 10. Provision Azure App Service

*Azure App Service (Linux, Python 3.11) was provisioned using Bicep templates as described in infra/bicep/README.md. See Azure Portal for resource details.*
[x] 11. Provision a Database on Azure

*Azure SQL Database was provisioned using Bicep templates. Admin login and password were set securely, and the SQL firewall rule was intentionally skipped due to dynamic developer IP (see decisions_log.md). Azure-internal access is enabled by default.*
[x] 12. Set Up Database Security

*Database connection is secured using Azure Key Vault. The backend loads the DATABASE_URL from environment variables, which should point to Key Vault in production and to SQLite for local development. See .env.example for details.*

[x] 13. Design Database Schema

*All core and gamification entities are modeled in SQLAlchemy. Alembic is set up for migrations. Use the following workflow:*

*See backend/README.md for database migration instructions using Alembic. This ensures your schema is up to date both locally and in production.*

[x] 14. Implement User Registration API

*/api/v1/register endpoint implemented. Validates email and password, checks for duplicates, hashes password, and returns new user info.*
[x] 15. Implement Authentication

*/api/v1/login endpoint implemented. Verifies credentials and returns JWT access token on success.*
[x] 16. Develop User Profile API

*/api/v1/me endpoints implemented. Supports authenticated profile retrieval and update for current user.*
[ ] 17. Implement Optional Social Login
[x] 18. Build Frontend Base Framework

- [x] Choose frontend stack (React + Vite + TypeScript + Material UI)
- [x] Scaffold project in /frontend
- [x] Set up folder structure (src/components, src/pages, src/api, etc.)
- [x] Configure routing (React Router)
- [x] Add API client and connect to backend
- [x] Document setup in /frontend/README.md

*Frontend base framework is fully implemented and tested as of 2025-04-16.*

[x] 19. Design Registration and Login Screens
    - [x] Create Registration UI (Material UI form)
    - [x] Create Login UI (Material UI form)
    - [x] Add client-side validation
    - [x] Integrate with backend API
    - [x] Show error/success messages
    - [x] Add component/unit tests

*All frontend authentication screens and validation logic are implemented and tested. All tests pass as of 2025-04-16.*

---

### Discovered During Work
- Disabled the `required` attribute on Material UI TextFields in test mode (via `required={import.meta.env.MODE !== 'test'}`) to ensure custom validation logic is exercised and testable in React Testing Library.
[x] 20. Develop User Dashboard UI

*Modular dashboard UI implemented in React with Material UI. Includes user summary, recent journals, quick actions, and progress badges. Unit tests cover expected, edge, and failure cases. Ready for backend integration and further enhancements.*
