As you complete tasks and reference relevant files, update this progress.md file as our memory to keep track of the project progress. Make sure all details of a task are clarified before starting implementation and before marking a task as done. After closing a task, add few words about where to find the changes and what has been done. Make sure all what we agree in the chat is documented in the decisions_log.md. Make sure the product specification is always up to date under specification.md.
All architecture, diagrams, and technology stack details are now documented in specification.md. This file will only track task progress and status updates going forward.

[x] 1. Finalize Product Requirements

*Product requirements, vision, and scope finalized based on user feedback. All details and agreements are documented in:*
- *decisions_log.md (finalized decisions and clarifications)*
- *specification.md (current product specification)*
- *PRS_original.md (original PRS for reference)*

[x] 2. Define Key Data Entities

*Key data entities for the MVP are now finalized and documented in:*
- *decisions_log.md (agreement and rationale)*
- *specification.md (current product specification)*

[x] 3. Architecture Design Document

*System architecture, data flow, and all diagrams are finalized and fully documented in:*
- *specification.md (see Architecture Design and User Journey Diagrams sections)*

[x] 4. Set Up Version Control

*Git repository initialized and connected to remote:*
- *https://github.com/GenAI-Gurus/phronesis*
- *.gitignore, README.md, and MIT LICENSE added and pushed to main branch.*
- *Project is ready for open-source collaboration and advanced user contributions.*

[x] 5. Initialize Python Project

*Modular FastAPI backend scaffolded in the `backend/` directory, designed for maintainability and AI-friendly expansion. See:*
- *backend/README.md (project overview)*
- *backend/STRUCTURE.md (folder and module structure)*
- *backend/requirements.txt (core dependencies)*

[x] 6. Establish Dependency Management

*Poetry installed and configured for the backend. Dependencies managed in pyproject.toml/poetry.lock. requirements.txt is now obsolete and will be removed.*

[x] 7. Design Backend Folder Structure

*Backend folder structure is modular, AI-friendly, and documented in backend/STRUCTURE.md. Ready for scalable development.*
